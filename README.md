## Hi there, I’m Ranwei Zhang 👋

I’m a **Software Development graduate** who enjoys building **interactive systems** at the intersection of **game programming, computer graphics, and applied AI**. I’m particularly interested in how low-level logic, real-time systems, and visual feedback come together to create engaging user experiences.

Most of my work focuses on **C/C++ game and graphics programming**, **Android application development**, and **AI-assisted learning tools**. I enjoy working close to the system level — handling things like rendering pipelines, animation logic, collision detection, and real-time updates — while also exploring how AI can be applied in practical, human-focused contexts.

GitHub is where I experiment, build, and refine ideas through projects and prototypes, often growing them iteratively from simple concepts into more complete systems.
